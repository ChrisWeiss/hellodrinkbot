# Hello Drinkbot case designs

This (will be) a selection of different case designs which will work with
the hello drinkbot pumps and electronics.

- [Basic Box](basic_box/README.md) Holds the pumps and electronics and is
suitable as a demonstration, or when used as part of a larger structure.

- [Motor plates](motor_plates/README.md) Various options to hold 4, 7, or
8 pumps.

- [Stand alone](stand_alone/README.md) A basic box that has been extended
a bit so that it stands by itself, with some affordances offered to manage
the dispensing tubing. (still being designed)
