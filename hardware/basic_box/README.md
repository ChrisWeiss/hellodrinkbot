# Basic Box

Laser cut from 6 mm (1/4") material. Use 24 M3-12mm screws and nuts to fasten 
the case together.

This is a basic box with openings cut for four peristaltic pumps, mounting
holes for a Raspberry Pi, and  holes for the a monitor cable, 12 volt power
cable, and USB cable to come out.  

This needs to be placed on a shelf, or other support, or mounted to something 
in order to have it above the supply bottles. No affordance as yet exists for
managing the dispensing side of the tubes.
